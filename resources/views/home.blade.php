<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>Come on! You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me. Yes. You're a great help to us. You're a natural leader... No! That's not it. Come on. Aahhh - uh huh! Come on. 
    You're imagining things. Am I? Then why are you following me? Afraid I was going to leave without giving you a goodbye kiss? I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee. I can arrange that. 
    You could use a good kiss!
    No, I don't have a landing permit. I'm trying to reach Lando Calrissian. Whoa! Wait a minute! Let me explain. You will not deviate from your present course. Rather touchy, aren't they? 
    I thought you knew this person. Well, that was a long time ago. I'm sure he's forgotten about that. Permission granted to land on Platform Three-two-seven. Thank you. 
    There's nothing to worry about. We go way back, Lando and me. Who's worried?
    Luke. Father. Son, come with me. Ben, why didn't you tell me? Chewie! It's Vader. Luke...it is your destiny. Ben, why didn't you tell me?
    What do you want? Well, it's Princess Leia, sir. She's been trying to get you on the communicator. I turned it off. I don't want to talk to her. Oh. Well, Princess Leia is wondering about Master Luke. 
    He hasn't come back yet. She doesn't know where he is. I don't know where he is. Nobody knows where he is. What do you mean, nobody knows? Well, uh, you see... Deck Officer. Deck Officer!
    Luke! Luke, don't - it's a trap! It's a trap! The Force is with you, young Skywalker. But you are not a Jedi yet.
    Admiral. Yes, Captain I think we've got something, sir. The report is only a fragment from a probe droid in the Hoth system, but it's the best lead we've had. 
    We have thousands of probe droids searching the galaxy. I want proof, not leads! The visuals indicate life readings. It could mean anything. 
    If we followed every lead... But, sir, the Hoth system is supposed to be devoid of human forms. You found something? Yes, my lord. That's it. The Rebels are there. 
    My lord, there are so many uncharted settlements. It could be smugglers, it could be... hat is the system. And I'm sure Skywalker is with them. Set your course for the Hoth system. 
    General Veers, prepare you men.
    Ready for some power? Okay. Let's see now. Put that in there. There you go. Now all I have to do is find this Yoda...if he even exists. Still...there's something familiar about this place. 
    I feel like...I don't know... Like we're being watched! Away with your weapon! I mean you no harm. I am wondering, why are you here? I'm looking for someone. Looking? 
    Found someone, you have, I would say, hmmm? Right. Help you I can. Yes, mmmm. don't think so. I'm looking for a great warrior. Ahhh! A great warrior. Wars not make one great.
    Bounty hunters. We don't need that scum. Those Rebels won't escape us. Sir, we have a priority signal from the Star Destroyer Avenger. 
    Right. ...there will be a substantial reward for the one who finds the Millennium Falcon. You are free to use any methods necessary, but I want them alive. No disintegrations. 
    As you wish. Lord Vader! My lord, we have them.
    This ground sure feels strange. It doesn't feel like rock at all. There's an awful lot of moisture in here. I don't know. I have a bad feeling about this. Yeah. Watch out! Yeah, that's what I thought. 
    Mynock. Chewie, check the rest of the ship, make sure there aren't any more attached. They're chewing on the power cables. Mynocks? Go on inside. We'll clean them off if there are any more. Ohhh! 
    Go away! Go away! Beastly thing. Shoo! Shoo! Wait a minute... All right, Chewie, let's get out of here!
    Afraid there's not much left. What was it? Droid of some kind. I didn't hit it that hard. It must have had a self-destruct. An Imperial probe droid. It's a good bet the Empire knows we're here. 
    We'd better start the evacuation.</p>
